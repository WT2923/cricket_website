          <h2>Cricket Basics</h2>
          <p>
            Cricket, at its heart, is a very simple game. The team batting first tries to score the maximum number of runs (points). The objective of the fielding is to restrict batters by getting them out and stop them from scoring runs. After a set number of balls, or if in case all the batter in the team get out, the teams switch roles and the team batting second needs to score one run more than their opponents to win the match.
